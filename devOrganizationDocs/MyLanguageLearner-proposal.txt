Language learning app with Mymemory api
-select langauge, have units with different type of prhases programed
 in, give text in either english or target language, 
ask to translate it, show result and ask if right, 
since there will be nuances.


Allow going on to more difficult lessons once easier ones are completed.



Project Proposal - MyLanguageLearner
-This will use node.js, react.
-It will be both backend and frontend even split
-It will be a website
-This website will be for english language speakers looking to learn another language, or at least the basics
-People about to travel wanting to get some travel words and phrases, and basic language learners
-MyMemory API

A) Creating this project, will consist of a database schema with users, their target languages, and progress of each unit.
B) Some issues with the api is it being a translator, sometimes the translations won't be perfect, it will ask the user if they were right if it comes back with an incorrect answer
C) No sensitive information to secure other than users' passwords
D) functionality:
	a) Select language to learn, users can have mulitple
	b) learn basic words and then phrases by category in app
	c) track progress
	d) give exp
E) user flow will look like:
	a) user signs up
	b) selects first target language
	c) starts learning
	d) progresses through, and can add other languages
f) This is more than a crud app because it allows language learning, grants experience for playing, and has restricted access based on unit and language
