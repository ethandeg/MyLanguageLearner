# MyLanguageLearner Backend

## API - My Memory Api - https://api.mymemory.translated.net

## Server Deployed - https://mylanguagelearner-backend.herokuapp.com

### Uses

#### Language learning, the api is a translator, and the database is seeded with units, subunits, and lessons, that get translated and sent to the front end as material

#### Flashcard and deck functionality allow users to repeat tricky material so that it will stick with them

#### Can learn more than 10 languages (more coming soon...)

#### The server flow works so that a user's requests are authenticated, authorized and sent back with either the requested information or messaging.
